                <h2>Motivation</h2>
                <p>
                    The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is an American media franchise and shared universe that is centered on a series of superhero films,
                    independently produced by Marvel Studios and based on characters that appear in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.
                    The franchise has expanded to include comic books, short films, television series, and digital series.
                    The shared universe, much like the original Marvel Universe in comic books, was established by crossing over common plot elements,
                    settings, cast, and characters. Phil Coulson, portrayed by Clark Gregg, is an original character to the MCU and the only character
                    to appear across all the different media of the MCU.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The MCU increased interest in Marvel comic books and characters, and as a result created an opportunity for a app to be built such that,
                    it would provide a gateway for new fans of the Marvel properties.

            <section typeof="sa:MaterialsAndMethods" id="interaction">
                <h2>Interaction design patterns used</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Carousel Pattern
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The user needs to browse through a set of items and possibly select one of them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This pattern is used throughout the web app idea, mostly in "popular" or "recommended" sections of a certain page
                            be it comic or events. This informs the user that there are more items available then what is currently seen on the scree.
                            At the same time only a few items are shown at a time, such that the user doesn't become confused by the sheer amount of
                            items available
                        </p>
                        <p></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Gamification
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Gamification is the application of game-design elements and game principles in non-game contexts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The pattern is mostly used on the Mobile app idea, where gaining a new character and adding it to your collection
                            requires the completion of a physical "fetch quest". At the end of the route the user is rewarded with the character and
                            new characters become available.
                        </p>
                        <p></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Completion
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Provide a feeling of closure by rewarding users at the completion of a goal.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As with the Gamification pattern, the Completion pattern is also used on the Mobile app Idea.
                            When the user collects a new character, new ones are unlocked, and become available for collection, offering the user
                            an incentive to find all the related characters and complete a collection.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Notifications
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The user wants to be informed about important updates and messages
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the Mobile app design the user can receive a notification nearby characters, relative to his location.
                            Once opened, the app can plot a course to the character so it can be collected.
                        </p>
                        <p></p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
