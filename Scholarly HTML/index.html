                <h2>Motivation</h2>
                <p>
                    The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is an American media franchise and shared universe that is centered on a series of superhero films,
                    independently produced by Marvel Studios and based on characters that appear in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.
                    The franchise has expanded to include comic books, short films, television series, and digital series.
                    The shared universe, much like the original Marvel Universe in comic books, was established by crossing over common plot elements,
                    settings, cast, and characters. Phil Coulson, portrayed by Clark Gregg, is an original character to the MCU and the only character
                    to appear across all the different media of the MCU.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The MCU increased interest in Marvel comic books and characters, and as a result created an opportunity for a app to be built such that,
                    it would provide a gateway for new fans of the Marvel properties.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section typeof="sa:MaterialsAndMethods" id="interaction">
                <h2>Interaction design patterns used</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Carousel Pattern
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The user needs to browse through a set of items and possibly select one of them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This pattern is used throughout the web app idea, mostly in "popular" or "recommended" sections of a certain page
                            be it comic or events. This informs the user that there are more items available then what is currently seen on the scree.
                            At the same time only a few items are shown at a time, such that the user doesn't become confused by the sheer amount of
                            items available
                        </p>
                        <p></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Gamification
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Gamification is the application of game-design elements and game principles in non-game contexts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The pattern is mostly used on the Mobile app idea, where gaining a new character and adding it to your collection
                            requires the completion of a physical "fetch quest". At the end of the route the user is rewarded with the character and
                            new characters become available.
                        </p>
                        <p></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Completion
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Provide a feeling of closure by rewarding users at the completion of a goal.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As with the Gamification pattern, the Completion pattern is also used on the Mobile app Idea.
                            When the user collects a new character, new ones are unlocked, and become available for collection, offering the user
                            an incentive to find all the related characters and complete a collection.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Notifications
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The user wants to be informed about important updates and messages
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the Mobile app design the user can receive a notification nearby characters, relative to his location.
                            Once opened, the app can plot a course to the character so it can be collected.
                        </p>
                        <p></p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section typeof="sa:MaterialsAndMethods" id="implementation">
                <h2>Implementation</h2>

                <p>
                    The main page is also a landing page, meant to attract users by displaying a 3D carousel with popular comics.
                    The page has two call to action buttons and a lead text meant to describe the purpose of the application
                    and what the potential users can expect from it.

                    The two lead buttons point to the two main features of the application: comics and characters, with the emphasis on the comic books
                    page.
                </p>

                <p>
                    By scrolling down on the lead page, as well as clicking the main call to action button, a comics section can be reached where
                    comics are listed in grid.
                    The selection of comics can be narrowed down by applying different filters.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Similar to the comic list section a character list is present where the user can find and apply different filters
                    to help him find the desired character.

                    Along with the basic character data, some related events and comics are also displayed to keep the user interested and invested in finding
                    out more.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The events page provides a simple but comprehensive view at the whole marvel history in a single vertical timeline ordered chronologically.
                    As you scroll down more data will be loaded allowing you to go to the beginning of the Marvel comic book Universe.
                </p>

                <h2>Next steps</h2>
                <p>
                    The logical next steps for the application is to add some user interaction components to keep the user engaged, such as a rating system
                    for the comic and characters, a comment system, a news feed, notifications.

                    By adding these new features a new section of the user base can be reached, while keeping the initial idea of ease of use
                    and simpleness intact.
