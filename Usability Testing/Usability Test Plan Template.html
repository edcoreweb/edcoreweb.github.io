				<h5>Overall Objectives</h5>
				<p>We want to check the overall effectiveness of the <strong>Marvelious</strong> application by testing how fast different users can see the desired data: like characters, events, details. We want to find if the application is intuitive enough by identifing the obstacles of completing the below tasks. In this way we cand determinate how the user experience can be improved.

				<h5>Tasks</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>Find "Hawkeye" comic book in the slide bar: <span>10 seconds</span>;</li>
						<li>Find "Incredible Hulk" comic book: <span>20 seconds</span>;</li>
						<li>Find related series to "IronMan" comic book: <span>35 seconds</span>;</li>
						<li>Filter character page by... : <span>15 seconds</span></li>
						<li>Find the fifth incomming event: <span>15 seconds</span></li>

						<li>Were the tasks  hard?</li>
						<li>Could you suggest other tasks?</li>

				<h5>Notes for Test Coordinator</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Remind the user that you would like them to 'think aloud' so 
that you can understand what they are thinking, about the task or the 
product/application;</li>
					<li>Read the user the scenario for the test;</li>
					<li>Read the user the tasks he has to complete. If the tasks are 
complex, you may want to put a sheet of paper in front of the user with 
each task written out;</li>
					<li>Record the user's actions, comments, questions, and body 
language (write them in the Test Observations section accompanied by 
video/audio).</li>
					<li>Don't offer help; let the user attempt to perform the task. If 
they ask for help reply with: "What do you think you/that would do?" 
"What do you think that means?".</li>

			<p>The user find all tasks quite simple, finishing most of them in half the time. However he specified that the carousel animation could be faster and that finding related comics of characters was not that intuitive. </p><p>His overall experience was good, but he would have appreciated much harders tasks.</p><p> He was more than happy to accept being called in further case studies.</p>

			<p>The user managed to finish all the tasks, but with some delays. Finding a comic book in the carousel and in the comics page was pretty easy for her. She found related comic books to "Iron man", but after she checked all the pages (55 seconds).
			<p>Using filters was not a challenge for her.</p>
			<p>She specified that the order of the incomming events is vague as it is not directly specified if its ascending or descending.</p>
			<p>Good overall experience as she will also participate in next studies.</p> </p>

			<h5>Other Notes</h5>
			<p>The user had some difficulties in solving the tasks.</p>
			<p>Finding a comic book in the carousel and in the comics page were the easiest tasks for her. She wasn't able to find related comic books to "Iron man", but after she checked all the pages. She abandoned the search after one minute.</p>
			<p>Using filters was a little challenge for her</p>
			<p>She didn't understand the order of the incomming events and took a guess in the answer. The answer was correct.</p>
			<p>Average overall experience because she doesn't like spending time on the computer. She would prefer to not be contacted in the future studies.

			<h5>Post-test Questions Answers</h5>
			<p>The tasks were pretty easy. We were suggested other tasks. Most of the userd enjoyed browsing the application and they will take part in next studies.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="usabilityTestResultsInfo">
			<h5>Test Observations</h5>
			<p>The tasks could have been harder. However, the good results satisfies success criterio on almost every task which means that the application is pretty intuitive. The opions gathered from the users were reflected and we come with some design improvements.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="otherDetails">
			<h5>Potential Design Improvements</h5>
			<p>The carousel animation can be faster and the next button could not wait for the animation to finish in order to proceed to the next comic book</p>
			<p>Related topics should be me more intuitive to find</p>
			<p>Every event should have a date on it, to know the chronological order</p>
